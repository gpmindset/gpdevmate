# üß† gpdevmate ‚Äî A Simple AI Code Review Agent for GitHub Pull Requests

**gpdevmate** is an AI-powered GitHub bot and CLI tool that automatically reviews pull requests or local code with helpful, structured feedback ‚Äî just like a senior developer would.

It leverages LLMs to analyze code diffs and leave high-quality review comments directly on your PRs or console *(If you use CLI)*.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project has **not been tested in production-level environments**. It is a work-in-progress portfolio project intended for learning and experimentation.

Please **use it cautiously** and manually verify all suggestions made by the AI before applying them to your codebase.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üîß 1. Fork & Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpdevmate.git
cd gpdevmate
pnpm install
```

### üîê 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `github-bot` or `cli` package (depending on usage):

```env
APP_ID=github-app-id
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret

MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
(optional)OPENAI_BASE_URL=your-base-url
```

> You can use OpenAI or switch to local LLM providers like Ollama *(In future)*.

---

### üöÄ 3. Run the GitHub Bot Locally

```bash
pnpm run build:gpdevmate-bot
pnpm run start:gpdevmate-bot
```

> Make sure you‚Äôve set up your GitHub App and forwarded webhooks (e.g., using `smee.io` or `ngrok`).

---

### üß™ 4. Run the CLI Review

> The CLI will scan your project, build a prompt with all files, and output feedback to the console. For more [Check Here](./packages/cli/README.md)

---

## ü§ñ How It Works

1. You open a pull request *(or run CLI)*
2. `gpdevmate` fetches the changed files
3. It filters out binary and formatting-only files
4. Builds a single prompt with all relevant changes
5. Sends the prompt to the LLM
6. Posts the review feedback as a PR comment or prints it in the terminal *(If you use CLI)*
