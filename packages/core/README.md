## ðŸ§  GPdevmate Core

This is the internal core library that powers the core logic behind `gpdevmate`.

It is designed to be shared across:

- [gpdevmate CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sgprakas/gpdevmate) â€” for running code reviews locally
- GitHub Bot â€” for reviewing pull requests using AI

Built to be simple, modular, and token-aware, the core provides shared utilities like prompt generation, file planning, and LLM review handling.
