## Issues and Suggestions

- **Missing Type Annotations**: TypeScript is designed to provide type safety. The function parameters `x` and `y` should have explicit type annotations to improve code clarity and prevent potential runtime errors.

- **Function Naming**: The function name `a` is not descriptive. It's a good practice to use meaningful names that convey the purpose of the function.

- **Use of `let`**: The variable `z` can be declared using `const` instead of `let`, as its value does not change after assignment. This can help prevent accidental reassignment.

- **Console Logging**: While logging the result is useful for debugging, it may not be appropriate in production code. Consider using a logging library or removing it altogether if not needed.

- **Formatting**: Consistent formatting improves readability. Ensure proper indentation and spacing.

## Improved Code Example

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the code with the suggested improvements:

```typescript
function addNumbers(x: number, y: number): number {
    const result = x + y;
    console.log("Result is:", result); // Consider removing this in production
    return result;
}
```

## Additional Recommendations

- **Error Handling**: Depending on the context, you might want to add error handling to manage cases where `x` or `y` are not numbers.

- **Unit Tests**: Consider writing unit tests for this function to ensure it behaves as expected with various inputs.

- **Documentation**: Adding JSDoc comments to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return type can enhance maintainability and usability.
